            <p>Storm Area 51 is a satirical Facebook event that calls for an assembly of a flash mob to infiltrate the
                top-secret American military airbase in Lincoln County, Nevada, scheduled to commence at 3:00 a.m. on
                September 20th, 2019. Since its launch in late June, the Facebook page went viral and millions of people
                have signed up to attend.</p>

                <h1>Background</h1>
                On June 27th, 2019, three anonymous Facebook users "Shitposting cuz im in shambles," "Smyleekun" and
                "The Hidden Sound" created the event page "Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us," scheduled to
                commence at 3:00 a.m. on September 20th, 2019.[1] The description reads, "We will all meet up at the
                Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry. If we naruto run, we can move faster
                than their bullets. Let's see them aliens."

                Viral Breakout
                According to Matty Roberts, a 20-year-old California resident and Bakersfield College student who
                co-created the event, the Facebook page saw little traction during the first 72 hours of listing and
                then suddenly took off. By July 8th, more than 120,000 Facebook users had RSVPd for the event, and by
                July 10th, the list of attendees had nearly doubled to 222,891.[6] By July 22nd, the number had once
                again doubled to more than 400,000 guests. As of July 22nd, the event has garnered more than 1.8 million
                RSVPs.

            <p>
                Over the following two weeks, "attendees" of the group made shitposts and satirical plans to storm the
                base. On July 5th, user Jackson Barnes[2] made a satirical plan to storm the base that gained over
                10,000 reactions. The plan reads:
                <br>
                <q>Ok guys, i feel like we need to formulate a game plan, Ive put together this easy to follow diagram
                    here for a proposed plan.

                    The basic idea is that the Kyles form the front line, if we feed them enough psilocybin and monster
                    energy and say that anyone in camouflage is their step dad, and the entire base is made of drywall
                    then they will go berserk and become an impenetrable wall.

                    Then the Rock Throwers will throw pebbles at the inevitable resistance (we don't want to hurt them,
                    we just want to annoy them enough to not shoot the Kyles as often). While this is all happening, the
                    two Naruto runner battalions will run full speed around the north and south flank, and shadow clone
                    jutsu, effectively tripling our numbers, and overwhelm the base (red circle).

                    P.S. Hello US government, this is a joke, and I do not actually intend to go ahead with this plan. I
                    just thought it would be funny and get me some thumbsy uppies on the internet. I'm not responsible
                    if people decide to actually storm area 51.</q>
